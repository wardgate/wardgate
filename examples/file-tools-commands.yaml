# Standard file tools for wardgate conclaves.
#
# These command templates wrap the Python scripts in scripts/file_*.py.
# Copy the commands you need into your conclave config, adjusting the
# script path and action (allow/ask) as needed.
#
# Scripts should be installed at /usr/local/lib/wardgate-tools/ in the
# conclave container (see Dockerfile.conclave).
